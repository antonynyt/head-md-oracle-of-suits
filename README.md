# Oracle of Suits

Exploring the History of Playing Cards through Gesture. We are designing embodied, playful, and accessible interactive experiences that tell the stories behind playing card suits for the Swiss Museum of Games.

##  Concept
An interactive game following the journey of an animated mustache escaping through a deck of cards. Visitors navigate short interactive “stories” and interact using a colorful razor, whose shaving motion reveals anecdotes. The whole experience is a playful metaphor for identity, rejection, and curiosity.
