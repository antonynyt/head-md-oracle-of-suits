### Test to see:
- How much of the story do they understand? (ex evil moustache)
- One tool or several tools? and Why?
- Should we make the graphics look more cards like? do they understand the story universe?

### feedback
- Good work! not much to test (note: we should have put more work)
- Tester don't understood the king story, the core concept (why moustache)
- Satisfying to shave, maybe add particles
- Didn't understand mutliple tools, maybe a tool for each scene

### Key takeaway
Even if the entire coding is not done, present using mixed media is ok (figma, imgs, etc.) goal is to understand our intent.

### TODO: Project Management
- List every screens and design
