I tried new approach: do nothing and help by watching Ali to code. We wanted to add a hitbox to the moustache so it escapes. The logic we had is to calculate the area of the moustache p5 graphic and then when cursor is in that area return true or whatever. But my p5 knowledge being 3/10 and not being a very fast learner idk. We tried with copilot but the hitbox was above the moustache image.

### UserTest to see:
- How much of the story do they understand? (ex evil moustache)
- One tool or several tools? and Why?
- Should we make the graphics look more cards like? do they understand the story universe?

### feedback
- Good work! not much to test (note: we should have put more work)
- Tester don't understood the king story, the core concept (why moustache)
- Satisfying to shave, maybe add particles
- Didn't understand mutliple tools, maybe a tool for each scene

### Key takeaway
Even if the entire coding is not done, present using mixed media is ok (figma, imgs, etc.) goal is to understand our intent.

for the stucture we need more light ideally because gesture detection needs light.

### TODO: Project Management
- List every screens and design
