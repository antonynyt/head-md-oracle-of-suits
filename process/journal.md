## Takeaway from the brief (2025-09-23)

designing embodied, playful, and accessible interactive experiences that tell the stories behind playing card suits for the Swiss Museum of Games.

- First element of the visit
- history, chronology
- court, suits, special cards
- understand that there are other cards than the french deck
- kids must understand, they know French suits (european centered)

They want if possible:
- Fun facts, humor
- Mini games

## Museum visit (2025-09-24)

- Small corner, door behind (do not open)
- Lot of playing stations, games
- Idealy minimum maintenance (reboot auto etc.)
- Le petit prince effect (universel et intemporal, + children & grown ups)
- Adapted to family, Inclusive, collaborative
- Important to have an Onboarding (how to interact + story)
- (my thinking:) would be cool to have something else than a game

## Research (2025-09-29) (2025-09-30)
_written 2025-10-03_

I researched the history of cards globally and looked for anecdotes about hidden details. I also played Balatro and explored interesting interactions:

- Flip dots, but instead of dots, playing cards
- Or Split-flap display with a satisfying sound like cards
- A gallery of living portraits across centuries
- Hand signs showing the correct suits

## Ideation (2025-10-01)
_written 2025-10-03_

I based my research mainly on finding anecdotes related to playing cards (like the ace of spade named _"the hanging card"_). Then I started from individual facts to generate ideas.

The main idea that emerged is the following:
Storytelling about **"The Lost Moustache."** A talkative little moustache is trying to find its way back to its owner. It travels through different cards, and each card tells a story but none are the right one until it reaches the King of Hearts.

## Thoughts on the process (2025-10-03)

After two weeks in a new work environment, I still haven’t found my professional footing. I lost my habits for example, I did research on playing cards but forgot to collect references. I also overthought my decisions and methodology, even though it’s quite similar to design thinking, something I already know well. It feels a bit like impostor syndrome.

I realized too late the value of field research. Since we’re creating an interaction, it’s different from what I usually do with 2D interface design (screens). That means I need to explore not only documentary or 2D interaction but also different ways of interacting with cards. Even though I did it a bit the 2025-09-29.

I also have some doubts about how to build a paper prototype that integrates the storytelling. I lack references. I'm used to UI paper prototype and I could imagine something physical but for some reason I was stunned. I'll figure it out later.

I searched and found an interesting example of storytelling through interaction: [Subway stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxP2EPP9d3g).

### Interesting responses from museum

- "Dig deeper than just the surface" (content)
- "Children are often drawn to the screens, and parents try to redirect their attention to the display cases."
- [...]"For roughly 99% of visitors, there is no prior historical knowledge."
- [...]"Storytelling is a powerful tool, of course, but it needs to be adapted for children (not too complex!)."
- "[...]the four french suit signs symbolize four classes of society [...] this hypothesis is most likely a retrospective construction. Especially since French signs seem to derive from stenciled German signs, German signs that seem to pay no attention to these symbolisms with their hearts, bells, leaves, and acorns."

## Paper prototype (2025-10-05)

First, I rethought the storytelling:

- The King of Hearts separates from his mustache, and it wants to know why.
- moustache goes on a quest to find fragments of time (facts about playing cards).
- The goal is to "catch" (interaction to be defined) 4 cards: one for each suit.
- Among the floating cards, there could be Mamluk or German cards, etc.
- Each card triggers a flashback with a fact.
- In the end the mustache goes back to the king and forgives him, the moustache understands (lost in the printing process).

In this way:

- Children catch the cards.
    - Either projected on the floor → they jump on them
    - Or projected on the wall
    - Or even physical with NFC cards
- Parents listen to / read the story.

Also did a new storyboard (user kinda journey) [Open image](./images/storyboard-2025-10-05.jpg)

### Problems / questions the prototype helped identify:

- Does the King of Hearts willingly separate from his mustache? Or did he lose it, and we need to remind him why?
- (visually speaking) Are these "fragements" about the history of cards (sharp corners, blank backs, symbols, indices suits) or actual cards (card design) with anecdotes?
    - This way, we could create a whole souvenir made of fragments the users as to collect
- There are too many inconsistencies, what is the mustache really doing in the story?
- There’s no clear link between the facts.
- Maybe it’s better to create fragments of a main story ([Zelda BoTW](https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/Memories)): like relics to collect, reconstructing the puzzle of the history of cards. This doesn’t exclude including anecdotes about court cards or visual details.
