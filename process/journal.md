## Takeaway from the brief (2025-09-23)

designing embodied, playful, and accessible interactive experiences that tell the stories behind playing card suits for the Swiss Museum of Games.

- First element of the visit
- history, chronology
- court, suits, special cards
- understand that there are other cards than the french deck
- kids must understand, they know French suits (european centered)

They want if possible:
- Fun facts, humor
- Mini games

## Museum visit (2025-09-24)

- Small corner, door behind (do not open)
- Lot of playing stations, games
- Idealy minimum maintenance (reboot auto etc.)
- Le petit prince effect (universel et intemporal, + children & grown ups)
- Adapted to family, Inclusive, collaborative
- Important to have an Onboarding (how to interact + story)
- (my thinking:) would be cool to have something else than a game

## Research (2025-09-29) (2025-09-30)
_written 2025-10-03_

I researched the history of cards globally and looked for anecdotes about hidden details. I also played Balatro and explored interesting interactions:

- Flip dots, but instead of dots, playing cards
- Or Split-flap display with a satisfying sound like cards
- A gallery of living portraits across centuries
- Hand signs showing the correct suits

## Ideation (2025-10-01)
_written 2025-10-03_

I based my research mainly on finding anecdotes related to playing cards (like the ace of spade named _"the hanging card"_). Then I started from individual facts to generate ideas.

The main idea that emerged is the following:
Storytelling about **"The Lost Moustache."** A talkative little moustache is trying to find its way back to its owner. It travels through different cards, and each card tells a story but none are the right one until it reaches the King of Hearts.

## Thoughts on the process (2025-10-03)

After two weeks in a new work environment, I still haven’t found my professional footing. I lost my habits for example, I did research on playing cards but forgot to collect references. I also overthought my decisions and methodology, even though it’s quite similar to design thinking, something I already know well. It feels a bit like impostor syndrome.

I realized too late the value of field research. Since we’re creating an interaction, it’s different from what I usually do with 2D interface design (screens). That means I need to explore not only documentary or 2D interaction but also different ways of interacting with cards. Even though I did it a bit the 2025-09-29.

I also have some doubts about how to build a paper prototype that integrates the storytelling. I lack references. I'm used to UI paper prototype and I could imagine something physical but for some reason I was stunned. I'll figure it out later.

I searched and found an interesting example of storytelling through interaction: [Subway stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxP2EPP9d3g).

### Interesting responses from museum

- "Dig deeper than just the surface" (content)
- "Children are often drawn to the screens, and parents try to redirect their attention to the display cases."
- [...]"For roughly 99% of visitors, there is no prior historical knowledge."
- [...]"Storytelling is a powerful tool, of course, but it needs to be adapted for children (not too complex!)."
- "[...]the four french suit signs symbolize four classes of society [...] this hypothesis is most likely a retrospective construction. Especially since French signs seem to derive from stenciled German signs, German signs that seem to pay no attention to these symbolisms with their hearts, bells, leaves, and acorns."

## Paper prototype (2025-10-05)

First, I rethought the storytelling:

- The King of Hearts separates from his mustache, and it wants to know why.
- moustache goes on a quest to find fragments of time (facts about playing cards).
- The goal is to "catch" (interaction to be defined) 4 cards: one for each suit.
- Among the floating cards, there could be Mamluk or German cards, etc.
- Each card triggers a flashback with a fact.
- In the end the mustache goes back to the king and forgives him, the moustache understands (lost in the printing process).

In this way:

- Children catch the cards.
    - Either projected on the floor → they jump on them
    - Or projected on the wall
    - Or even physical with NFC cards
- Parents listen to / read the story.

Also did a new storyboard (user kinda journey) [Open image](./images/storyboard-2025-10-05.jpg)

### Problems / questions the prototype helped identify:

- Does the King of Hearts willingly separate from his mustache? Or did he lose it, and we need to remind him why?
- (visually speaking) Are these "fragements" about the history of cards (sharp corners, blank backs, symbols, indices suits) or actual cards (card design) with anecdotes?
    - This way, we could create a whole souvenir made of fragments the users as to collect
- There are too many inconsistencies, what is the mustache really doing in the story?
- There’s no clear link between the facts.
- Maybe it’s better to create fragments of a main story ([Zelda BoTW](https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/Memories)): like relics to collect, reconstructing the puzzle of the history of cards. This doesn’t exclude including anecdotes about court cards or visual details.

- [ ] Find story progression

## Merge ideas in group (2025-10-07)

We merged ideas together with Alireza because we are both interested in:
- Fun, joyful, kid spirit
- Story based
- Progress
- Clue
- Physical
- Collect

We agreed in a interaction in which we collect fragments of the cards history, to complete the whole story.

## New ideations (2025-10-09)

We tried some new combinaisons between our stories but then came back to the moustache because it's a strong emotional element for children.

We also had some reflexions about problems but we had not our story defined so following Alexia's suggestions, we are refining the storyline and content details.

[New concept](./2025-10-09.md)

## Gesture Prototype (2025-10-13)

We prototyped some ideas using the moustache as the interface but it felt wrong and we were stuck on the concept. (1) We prototyped a moustache dresser app do shape it like a crown or help the characters to solve an issue they may have. (2) We prototyped a box with a hole shaped moustache. To see what the interaction could be.

We ended up with a lot independant pieces. That was too many constraints for one concept: moustache, gesture, historical anecdotes, liked between everything. Moustache as interface. It had lost his meaning.

Rémi suggested the reverse thinking ideation process. What happens if we put a mustache on all the cards?
So for our prototype we decided on 2 prototypes:
- (A) We are in a card barber. We have to shave the mustache off the cards. By shaving the mustache, we reveal a hidden detail on the card. The goal is to make the deck as close to reality as possible.
- (B) We have to put moustache using gesture on our face using our fingers.

## User Test A/B (2025-10-15)

We tested our 2 prototypes and got good insights on each.
- (A): storytelling is appealing, shaving mecanisim is interesting because the tester put the razor directly on the screen. plus the combo of razor, moustache, story is great. The tester wanted more freewill: [Tester want to scratch the UI](./images/usertest1-behaviour1.png), [User want to scratch legs](./images/usertest1-behaviour2.png).
- (B): we understand directly the gesture and the feedback was good, it was a bit repetitive and gesture were limited to what was planned.
- overall the concept is too focused on male gender. we should look a gender neutral element.

##  Light Pivot (2025-10-16)

We brainstormed to look for a new gesture or overall experience. But nothing concluant.
We adapted prototype A: The character is always waiting for someone to help him with the same gesture but in different ways.
We took an "baton" that can act as a multi-tool and make different situations. The cards present themself and have details or demands. we use our "baton" to solve their issue by scraching, stamping, etc.

## Back to initial with a twist (2025-10-28)

**Motivation: 6/10**

We went back again to moustache. Concept is now updated in Ali's GitHub. he wanted to be in charge of the "Captain's log" that fine so he learns GitHub :). And also how to log [Ali's GitHub](https://github.com/AlirezaAsna/head-md-oracle-of-suits/tree/main/concept).

I made a small code test to detect the hand closed based on Pierre boilerplate. Not satisfied yet on the calculations. Douglas suggested using angle instead of finger tip to hand distance. Heuristic for sure, no fine tuning.

I'm also starting to log my motivation. Just for my future me.

## Physical form (3.11)

**Motivation AM: 7/10 - PM: 4/10**

On a été surpris par l'installation soudaine de la structure physique pour la fin la semaine prochaine. C'est une bonne chose ça à redynamiser notre groupe pendant 10 minutes. Highlight: atelier bois, nouvel environnement loin du projet.

Avec Ali, on en avait pas vraiment re-réfléchi, j'ai pris quelques décisions sur ce que je me sens capable de faire. Et je suis un peu déçu. J'ai descendu mes attentes sur ce projet à -1203%.

## j'arrête ou pas? (2025-11-04)

**Motivation: j'arrête le master/10** — **Mood: boucle infernal négative**

[Le log est ici.](./2025-11-04.md)

Ah, on doit penser à la forme 3D du comment du pourquoi du rasoir pour jeudi matin:
- une presentation courte du concept:
- Jeudi -> 10 minutes expliquer l’avancement + tests

[Live du code amélioré d'aujourd'hui](https://antonynyt.github.io/head-md-oracle-of-suits/code/2025-11-03/grab-shaving) avec un [screenshot](./images/code-2025-11-04.png).

D'ailleurs les gestes c'est lent quand c'est loin, ou proche ou avec lumière ou pas avec lumière ou vitesse, surtout vite ça saute parfois.


## It's taking shape (2025-11-05)

**Motivation: 6/10**

We worked on the graphic design today and started implement the design and the first 2 sequences of the intro in the new [storyboard](./images/new-storyboard-2025-11-05.jpg). The main interaction (shaving is working fine). The second interaction (moustache escape, should work, it was implemented).

Ali made some [razors shapes](./images/rasor-2025-11-05.jpg) at the wood workshop and cool illustrations. We can then test which razor works the best. We keep in mind on Laure's input to how we want to present this rasor: holy rasor or bunch of rasor on a table.

Douglas helped a lot with understanding P5JS and the canvas concept. This is really a new world and I should take the time to read [NatureOfCode](https://natureofcode.com/)  and learn trigonometry (again).

PS: I read again some of my first personal logs. I already level up on some concepts/thoughts. Since i choose to make it public, hope Im not Oversharing. Infosec me would not agree with this (OSINT exists). This log is a security vulnerability.
