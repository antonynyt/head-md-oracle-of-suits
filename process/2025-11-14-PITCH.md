Welcome everyone to the Moustache project.

Our concept is about a moustache traveling through a deck of playing cards, uncovering the forgotten stories hidden inside each one.

Why the moustache you would ask ? It’s not because we both have it. It’s because our research showed two things:

- Real card anecdotes are irresistible
- Mascots like Clippy or Duolingo make experiences memorable

So why not use something that’s related to the cards?
In some French Deck the King of heart is the only King that doesn’t have a moustache. It’s a misprint that has been kept. Some decks have corrected it. But kept it.

We wanted to create an experience that makes people curious and brings these tiny forgotten details back to life. And also fun and absurd.

By following the journey of an animated moustache escaping through the deck, visitors navigate short interactive “stories” They interact using a colorful razor, whose shaving motion reveals anecdotes. The whole experience is a playful metaphor for identity, rejection, and curiosity. Because at after being rejected by most of the cards, the moustache realise it’s purpose is to be part of the universe.

A mix of storytelling, research-based facts, and tactile interaction — all wrapped into one unforgettable evil moustache.

Now let’s go for the demo, does someone want to try it ?
