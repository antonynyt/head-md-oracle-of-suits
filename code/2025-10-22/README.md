Third day of creative-coding explorations with p5.js. Introducing hand gestures. Gestures are kind of a blocker for me. I love to see cool and beautiful things but "what's the point?" I'm a bit bored with gesture. I don't know personally want to create with hand gestures, though I enjoyed seeing everyone's creativity and projects. 

I don't find much interest in controlling a screen with a gesture, even if creations like [@the.poet.engineer](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHBWj3cOZxR/) on Instagram are cool.

Douglas suggested a [field research](./gesture-research/) where I observed other students' gestures in the school.
